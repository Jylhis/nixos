#+author: Jylhis
#+TODO: Learn(r) Bug(r) InProgress(i) | Done(d)

Goal of this configuration is to provide everything I need for text editing/programming.

- Prefer built-in things, but if 3rd-party is clearly better, it's okay to use it, *but it should integrate well with emacs*
- Things should work with standalone emacs and also client/server

* Keybindings

Most used stuff should be at the "root" prefix.
Each prefix should have category that make sense.

To list personal keybinding: =describe-personal-keybindings=
and to list all keybindings: =Ctrl-h b= (=describe-bindings=)

NOTE: Universal-argument: =ctrl-u=

* Customize

=M-x customize= displays the Customize interface and all the
groups.
=M-x customize-browse= opens a tree group browser. Much
like the regular Customize interface but without the
group descriptions.
=M-x customize-customized= customizes
options and faces
that you have changed but not saved. Useful if you
want to tweak things.
=M-x customize-changed= displays all options changed since a
particular Emacs version. Good way to discover new
features and options.
=M-x customize-face= prompts for the name of a face to
Customize. I recommend you put your point on
the face you want to change. It’ll fill in the name
automatically.
=M-x customize-group= prompts
for a group name (e.g.,
python) to Customize.

=M-x customize-mode= customizes the major mode of your
current buffer. You should do this for every major
mode you use. It’s a quick way to change things and
gain an overview of what your major mode can do.
=M-x customize-saved= Displays all your saved options and
faces. Extremely handy if you want to track down
and disable errant changes.
=M-x customize-themes= Shows a list of installed themes you
can switch to.
